@property Decorator:

The @property decorator allows you to define a method in a class that can be accessed like an attribute, without the need to call it explicitly. In the example above, calcAveMarks is a method, but it can be accessed like a simple attribute (i.e., student1.calcAveMarks instead of student1.calcAveMarks()).

Itâ€™s particularly useful when you want to calculate or derive a value dynamically but present it as a read-only property of the class. It avoids the need to call a method explicitly while still computing the result.

Why Use @property:

It improves code readability because you can access a method like an attribute.
It encapsulates logic, allowing you to compute or modify values without exposing them directly as attributes.

    @property 
    def calcAveMarks(self):
        return (self.phymarks + self.mathmarks) / 2
