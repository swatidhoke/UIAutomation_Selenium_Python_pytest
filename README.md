<h1>Selenium Python Automation Framework</h1>

This project is a Selenium-based UI automation framework built with Python. It uses pytest as the testing framework and is designed for scalability, ease of use, and maintainability.

Key Folders and Files

pages: Contains the Page Object Model (POM) classes representing the structure of web pages.

utils: Contains utility classes for configuration, WebDriver management, and other helper functions.

test_cases: Contains the test scripts written using pytest.

drivers: Contains WebDriver executables required for browser automation.

config: Contains configuration files for the framework, such as test settings and logging configurations.

reports: Directory where test reports are generated after execution.

logs: Stores the log files generated during test execution.

requirements.txt: Lists all the Python dependencies needed for the project.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
Python 3.7 or higher

pip (Python package installer)

WebDrivers (e.g., ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver)

<h2>Installation</h2>
Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/swatidhoke/selenium-python-pytest.git

cd selenium-python-pytest

<h2>Install Dependencies</h2>

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

<h2>Install the required Python packages:</h2>

pip install -r requirements.txt

<h2>Configuration</h2>
WebDriver Configuration
Place the WebDriver executables (e.g., chromedriver, geckodriver) in the drivers directory or ensure they are accessible in your system's PATH.

<h2>Test Configuration</h2>
Modify the config/config.ini file to set up the necessary configurations like browser type, base URL, etc.

<h2>Logging Configuration</h2>
Logging configuration can be managed in the config/logging.conf file. Logs will be generated in the logs directory.

<h2>Running Tests</h2>
To run the test cases, navigate to the root directory of the project and use the following command:

pytest
Running Specific Tests
To run a specific test file:
 
pytest tests/test_cases/test_example.py

<h2>Generating Reports</h2>
pytest can generate HTML reports using the pytest-html plugin. Install it if necessary:
pip install pytest-html

<h2>Run the tests and generate an HTML report:</h2>

pytest --html=reports/report.html

Logging

Log files are generated by the framework in the logs directory. The logging level and format can be configured in the logging.conf file.

Example Test Case
Here’s an example of a simple test case that opens Google:

```
from selenium import webdriver

def test_google_search():
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path='./drivers/chromedriver')
    driver.get('https://www.google.com')
    assert 'Google' in driver.title
    driver.quit()

```
<h2>Dependencies</h2>
The requirements.txt file includes the following dependencies:

Selenium: For browser automation.

pytest: For test execution and structuring.

pytest-html: For generating HTML reports.
```
# Selenium for browser automation
